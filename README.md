# PyBer Analysis
## Purpose and Overview of Analysis
- Clean, organize, and visualize weekly ridesharing date from PyBer for different city types.
- Analyze different trends and patterns among the different city types to provide PyBer with recommendations for future business in these areas.
## Results
### Data Overview
- The following graph shows the total number of rides versus the average fair per ride for each city.
- There are fewer rides in rural areas but their fares are generally higher than those in urban areas.
- Suburban average fares are similar to rural average fares, with a few rural outliers being an exception.
- There are significantly more drivers and rides in urban and subruban areas than in rural areas.
- Although fares are lower, we can assume that urban total fares are much higher than rural or suburban because of their volume.

### Statistal Ride Fare Data Overview
- The following box and whisper plots shows ride fare data for each city type.
- The average fare was about $24 for urban cities, about $31 for suburban cities, and about $37 for rural cities.
- This shows that there is at least one outlier in the rural data. Urban and subruban fares are more consistent.

### Total Fares by City Type
- The following graph shows the average weekly fare for a given date set for the different city types.
- Urban total fares average almost four times higher than rural, with suburban total fares averaging almost double the rural fares.
- Average total fares stay relatively consistant throughout the time-frame with minor spikes in the spring time.

## Summary and Recommendations
- Demand for rides in urban cities is very high. We recommend incentivising more people to drive in cites with high volume and a small number of drivers.
- Start ad campaigns to increase the number of rides in rural areas. These areas usually have high fares per ride so more volume here would have a significant increase in cash flow.
- Increase rates in urban cities to increase the average fare. Demand is high enough in these areas to where a small increase in rates will not have an effect on volume.
